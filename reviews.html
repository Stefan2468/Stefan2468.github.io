		"We were referred to Larkfield Apartments through the Richmond American International University website. 
		The rates were comparible if not better than local hotels considering the amenities and proximity to public transportation. 
		<br><br> Arthur was very responsive and accommodating to our specific needs. We loved that the bus stop and Richmond train station were just a short walk from the apartment. 
		We had all the comforts of home, too: WiFi, kitchen, washer/dryer, etc. 
		<br><br> We were offered a bigger apartment on the lower level but honestly our family of four was comfortable in the Studio Apartment. 
		There was more than enough space for us in this quaint and cozy space.
		<br><br> The pillows and mattresses were comfortable and the linen and towels were fresh and clean. 
		(I would recommend "fluffing" the towels in the dryer for a short time.) I was very grateful to be able to cook meals for my family everyday. 
		Thank you for providing the basic pots/pans and utensils.
		<br><br> All in all I know our family will choose to stay at Larkfield Apartments (Studio) again the next time we come to Richmond. Many thanks!! Brian and Therese".

We had a very good stay in this place and we will recommend you to our family and friends. We probably will come again in this house because one week was not enough to visit all lovely places around. Thank you :)."

		Being former residents of the area, the house is conveniently placed between Richmond and St Margarets. <br>
		There's plenty of room for a family of five, and the house is well equipped with everything you could possibly need. I guess we will soon be back! Thank you!"
